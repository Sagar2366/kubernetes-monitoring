Differnt levels of Abstactions

OS have 2 layers :
Application -> OS Kernel -> Hardware

Docker and VM both are virtualization tools
Docker virtualize only Application layer and uses Host kernel
VM virtualizes entire OS and boots from own kernel

Docker VS VM -
1. Size of docker images are in MB, VM sizes can be in GB
2. Docker containers start and run much faster
